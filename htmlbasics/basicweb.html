        <h3>ALBUMS:</h3>
        <p>My Top 3 Albums Are:
            <ul>
                <li>1ST: Wolf (2013)</li>
                <li>2ND: Late Registration (2005) - Kanye West</li>
                <li>3RD: the color grey (2022) - jev. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Starting off with the color grey, its 8 track album including songs like "where's the confetti", "black samuarai" and "freedom or fame?" have great beats that make it great to listen to daily. While being quite underground, jev still continues to make great music. Late Registration by Kanye West has some of the biggest hits hes made, like Gold Digger, Touch the Sky and Diamonds From Sierra Leone. The beats and lyrics just fit so perfectly. My most favorite album, is Wolf by Tyler. The tracklist is perfect for besides 1 song and the story inside of it completeling the triolgy of his first 2 albums contributes so much to it. </p>
